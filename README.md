# Pomodoro Timer 

This project is part of the [Becode's](https://github.com/becodeorg/LIE-Jepsen-5.34/tree/master/02-the-hill/05-react/03-pomodoro) `Learning by doing` sort of challenges.

The ultimate gole is to develope a **Pomodoro Timer** using `React` as a development framework and `parcel` as a bundler tool and finaly deployed on `Netlify`.

The project was insipired by The **Pomodoro Technique** which is a time management method developed by **Francesco Cirillo** in the late 1980s.
The Pomodoro Technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a `pomodoro`, from the `Italian` word for `'tomato'`, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

Therefore as its's name suggestes this [Pomodoro App](https://mika-react-pomodoro.netlify.app/) will enable you to simulate the popular Pomodoro time management technique.

## How to use it
- Open the [Pomodoro App](https://mika-react-pomodoro.netlify.app/).
- Click on the `Start` button ... Your default working session should be able to automatically start counting down from `25` to `0`
- Once the time hit `00:00` it will request you either you want to **Take a break?** or **Keep Working**. The decition is on the tip of your finguers.
